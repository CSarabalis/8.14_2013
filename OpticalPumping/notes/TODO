Analysis:

	Categorize and estimate magnitudes of systematic errors for fixed B, vary f.

	Compute relaxation time and pumping time.

	Model the system with linear, first order ODE's and see if results are consistent with measured pumping rates.

Experimental:

	Collect data and create a visualization for the bucking out of earth's magnetic field.

	Test hypotheses following error analysis.
