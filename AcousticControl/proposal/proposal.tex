% PREAMBLE
% The preamble of a LaTeX document is the set of commands that precede
% the \begin{document} line.  It contains a \documentclass line
% to load the REVTeK-4.1 macro definitions and various \usepackage
% lines to load other macro packages.
%
% ADVICE TO STUDENTS: This preamble contains a suggested set of
%     class options to generate a ``Junior Lab'' look and feel that
%     facilitate quick review and feedback from one's peers, TA's
%     and section instructors.  Don't make substantial changes without
%     first consulting your section instructor.

\maketitle

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our objective is to create acoustic standing waves in one dimension in a fluid medium and use them to influence the position of free-floating and confined silica beads. Along the way, we propose the creation of a more direct means of controlling the fluid (as opposed to stage oscillation), broadening the space of possible experiments using Junior Lab's optical trap.

\section{Bead Mechanics}

We can model the motion of a silica bead in water using the framework of Newtonian mechanics.  The position of a bead, $x\left(t\right)$, in an elastic medium whose state is specified by its displacement over all space and time by $w\left(\vec{x},t\right)$ is governed by

\begin{equation}
F = m \ddot{x} = D\left(\dot{w}\left(x,t\right)-\dot{x}\right)\label{eq:newton}.
\end{equation}

The fluid is coupled to the bead via viscous drag, the magnitude of which is determined by the drag coefficient $D$ and the magnitude of the relative velocity of fluid flowing past the bead.   When $m \ll D$ (the low Reynolds number regime in which we are interested), Equation \ref{eq:newton} reduces to

\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = \dot{w}.
\end{equation}

We assume that the motion of the bead does not significantly alter the fluid.  In so doing, the equation of motion for the fluid is simply the wave equation with dispersion relation $\omega = c \vec{k}$, where $c$ is the speed of sound of the medium.  These equations admit to standing wave solutions for the velocity of the fluid $w\left(\vec{x},t\right)$ and thereby the bead $x\left(t\right)$, confining the bead between antinodes separated by $\lambda/2 = \pi/\vec{k}$.

\section{Scales and Trap Characteristics}

\section{Apparatus}

The flow channel will be constructed from a slide, a slip, and transparent material (probably glass) for spacing so as not to reflect the IR beam around the room. The layers can be adhered together with water-tight epoxy. The stiffness of the membrane on either end of the flow channel as well as the mass of the attached magnet is critical because of impedance matching. With fixed cross section of ~1 mm2, the longitudinal linear dimension of the magnet in the axis of the flow channel can be adjusted to adjust the mass of the oscillator. This dimension affects the magnetization of the magnet and therefore the current necessary to drive a wave of a particular amplitude given a number of turns of the coil N. Furthermore each coil must be impedance matched to the function generator with 50Ï‰ impedance.

The coils are to be no bigger in cross section than a pencil. They should be easy both to remove and setup on the apparatus.

We'd like to construct both a channel with two transducers, and a channel with one transducer and an ~infinite impedance termination. We predict the latter will ease the creation of standing waves but not controllably in the aforementioned sense.
