function [a,aerr,chisq,yfit,corr] = levmar(x,y,sig,fitfun,a0,dYda,sgn)

% levmar.m Fits a nonlinear function to data using the Marquardt
%                     method discussed in Bevington and Robinson in Sections 8.5 & 8.6.
%           This method uses a variable 'lambda' to moderate an algorithm
%           between two extremes:
%           For lambda very small, solution is an 'expansion algorithm'
%           For lambda very big, solution is the gradient algorithm
%
%    Inputs:  x -- the x data to fit
%             y -- the y data to fit
%             sig -- the uncertainties on the data points
%             fitfun -- the name of the function to fit to
%             a0 -- the initial guess at the parameters
%             sgn, dYda -- if sgn=0, use numerical derivatives;
%                          if sgn=1, use analytic expressions for
%                          derivatives stored in the cell "dYda"
%    Outputs: a -- the best fit parameters
%             aerr -- the errors on these parameters
%             chisq -- the final value of chi-squared
%             yfit -- the value of the fitted function
%                     at the points in x
%             corr -- error matrix = inverse of the curvature matrix alpha
