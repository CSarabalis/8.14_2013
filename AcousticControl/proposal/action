bead mechanics - done. just needs refinement
scales & trap mechanics - 
apparatus - 
measurements - 
schedule - 

impedance matching --
--impedance ("spring constant") of medium needs to match impedance of transducer
(picture shaking rope connected to chain - need 'spring constant' of rope to match that of chain so as not to get reflections)

apparatus building --
